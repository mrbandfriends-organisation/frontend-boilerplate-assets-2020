# Frontend Boilerplate Assets

Core CSS and JavaScript boilerplate for Mr B & Friends.

Updated October 2020 

## Style Guide and Code Formatting

All JavaScript is auto formatted to a normalised style guide using the [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) code analyser. You will need to install this globally using

`npm install -g prettier --save`

When you commit your files `prettier` will be run against all `*.js` files and your code will be auto formatted to maintain our styles.
